[Procedure calls]

Within a procedure, data addressing falls into four categories: 

• The caller can pass arguments to the procedure.

• Local variables are allocated withing procedure and freed before the procedure returns.

• Local static data is stored in a fixed location in memory and is private to the procedure.

• Global static data is stored in a fixed location in memory and can be referenced from many different procedures.
